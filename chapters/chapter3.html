<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<h2>The Surgery</h2>
<h2>Before surgery crisis</h2>
Dialysis was slowly breaking Papa. Day by day, it made him weaker — not just in his body, but in his spirit. He was never the kind of person who could bear such pain. And now, every week, three times a week, he had to go to the hospital and lie there for hours, doing nothing, while the machine did what his kidneys no longer could.

For Papa, the hardest part wasn't just the treatments — it was the restrictions. He has always been a water person, someone who drank a lot of water without even thinking. But when your kidneys fail, doctors warn you to drink less, because water will collect inside your body and cause swelling. For him, this was torture.

Then one day, Dr. Taha Mateen told him:
"You have two choices — continue dialysis… or go for a kidney transplant."

That sentence changed everything. Suddenly, our days were filled with a storm of questions. Who will be the donor? How will we arrange that much money? What if the surgery fails? What if something happens to Dad? It wasn't an easy decision — a transplant is a major, risky surgery. But in everyone's heart, even through the fear, there was a small light of hope. Whatever it was, we knew one thing: we were together, and we would fight for him.

Papa, despite all his pain, told me one day, "I will live for you guys. I want to spend each and every moment with you. I don't want to go." He's emotional, very sensitive. I think I got that from him. Mumma, on the other hand, Alhamdulillah, is strong — the one who held all of us together.

But life didn't give us time to focus only on Papa. 
<h2>Broken  mid-storm </H2>
In the middle of all this, I — Raisa — fell sick. It started with stomach pain, vomiting, and high fever for two days. One night, I couldn't keep even water down. Mumma gave Papa his dinner and medicine, then rushed me to the nearest hospital. The doctor examined me and said, "Admit her for a while, her symptoms aren't good."

Mumma asked how many days, and the doctor said, "No, just an IV. There's some infection that won't go with medicines." I stayed from 10 p.m. to midnight while my Nani sat with me — Mumma had to go back home to look after Papa. They didn't remove the cannula from my hand; I had to come for three more days for the IV. I couldn't go to college.

The next day, after my IV, the doctor suggested a scan. That night, we went to a scanning center. The reports came back: appendicitis — immediate surgery needed. My heart sank. Why now? Why when my parents were already going through so much?

We decided to get a second opinion from Dr. Lata Singh at HBS. She looked at my reports and shook her head. "I don't trust these. Get another scan at Precision." We went there with my Chachi. The place was packed, and I waited for six hours before my turn. Finally, they scanned me and said, "It's not appendix, it's a bad infection in the intestines and its called Typhillitis."

That night, my mom and Chachi showed the results to Dr. Lata Singh, and she said I needed to be admitted — IVs were the only way to cure it. So the next day, I got admitted to the same hospital where Papa was having dialysis. I was on the 4th floor, Papa's dialysis was on the 2nd.

The room I shared had an elderly lady with kidney stones who was in constant pain and would yell if I made any noise. I had no internet, no comfort — just the ceiling to stare at. Nani stayed with me some nights, my Chachi others. One day, Papa came to see me after his dialysis. He stood there quietly, looking at me. my face had swollen because of continous drips, i looked chubby dad made fun of me made me smile and left home. My heart broke — I should've been there for him, not lying in a hospital bed myself.

Then, my hand swelled badly from the IV — red, itchy, almost bursting. Chachi rushed to the nurse, who stopped the drip and removed the cannula. Later, they had to insert it in my other hand. I was terrified, but the nurse smiled, "Kuch nahi hota beta, trust me." She was right — it didn't even hurt. Then finally the next day the doctor came for rounds and she told me im good i can go home finallyyy. I was still tired n nauseous so i was at home resting n getting well i hvent attended college for almost two weeks. Alhamdulilah i got better.

<h2> Decision pending</h2>
Finally, news began to spread among relatives: we were planning for a kidney transplant. People were shocked, emotional — but many came forward, offering help and support. My sisters and I began debating who would donate. My elder sister said she would, I said I would too. But Mumma scolded us, "None of you are donating!" We didn't understand why. The truth was harsh — being young, unmarried girls, society's mentality was that no one would marry us if we had one kidney. It was stupid, but real.

Then, my cousin brothers came forward, saying, "We'll donate to Mama, whichever of us matches." Again, they were refused — they were too young, with their whole lives ahead. My Phupha offered, but he wasn't a close relative by blood. My Nani insisted, "I'm old, I'll die in a few years. Give mine, Adil should live." But Papa refused — she was our only surviving grandparent.

Through all this, one person never wavered — Mumma. From the start, she wanted to be the donor. But almost everyone, including my sisters and extended family, opposed it. "If the surgery goes wrong, what will the kids do without their mother?" they asked. Only I and my Chachu supported her.

The decision was getting closer. The clock was ticking. And soon… we would all find out who would give Papa the gift of life.

And that's when Papa's uncle — my grandfather's brother — came forward. He said he would donate.
We asked him, “Did you ask your kids and wife about this?”
He said, “No, I didn't. But I'll manage.”

Hearing that gave us hope. In front of so many doctors, he stood there and said he would donate. But a few days later, Papa went for a walk, and his uncl's son called him. He said,
“We didn't know he wanted to donate. Please don't accept it. We don't want him to give his kidney.”

Papa was shaken. This was the same man who had the courage to come in front of doctors and claim he would donate. And now, his own son was saying this. Papa was disappointed. After that, his uncle disappeared and never came back.

From the very beginning, Mumma had the feeling she was the one meant to do this. When the doctors suggested that the wife could be the donor,I, my Nani and my Chachu were the first ones to encourage her. But no one else did. Others were scared for her including dad he dint want her to go through all the pain and he wanted her to be with kids if something happens to him but mumma dint go back and never said "okayy i wont give" she was tough with her decision she wanted to live so that she lives she couldnt see him like this so she never took her decision back and finally my dad also had to agree with her.

When my Mumma's cousin brothers heard she wanted to donate, they were so worried. They rushed to her, telling her,
“Don't even say such things. We'll find another donor for him. Why are you telling this?”
they were worried about her and us too.

Days passed, and somehow everyone felt she was the one and everyone agreed and the tests went on. Finally, the results came — Mumma's kidneys, blood group, everything matched. She was the one.

Then came the long transplant process — all the official requirements, the police inquiry to confirm that this surgery wasn't being forced by Papa. They even recorded everything, asking questions about why she wanted to do it. Every legal and government procedure had to be cleared before the operation could be approved.

At last, Mumma was declared a ready donor. But the surgery date kept getting delayed. First, they said it would be in January. Then it was pushed to the first week of February. Then the second week. And when the date was finally set, we didn't even realize until later that it was 14th February — Valentine's Day.

That was also the exact day my 1st PU final exams were starting. My first exam was Maths. My cousin's mom, who had been texting me almost every day, kept checking in with concern and sending love. Her messages were heartwarming in those tense days.

Two days before the surgery, both Mumma and Papa had to be hospitalized for body check-ups and observations. It was early morning, Fajr time, when they were leaving. We all woke up, prayed namaz, kissed them, and told them to come back soon. We were all hiding our tears, sending them off with smiles — even though our hearts were breaking.

The house felt different the moment they left. It wasn’t just quiet — it was empty. The familiar sounds of Mom bustling around and Dad calling out to us were gone. Every corner felt still, like the walls themselves were holding their breath. Even though we sisters were together, it didn’t feel like home without them. That silence was louder than any noise we’d ever heard.

<h2>Surgery: The Big Day </h2>

The night before the surgery was terrifying. It felt as if my parents were preparing to go into battle. The hospital followed a strict pre-surgery protocol — they were bathed repeatedly, almost ten times, their entire room sanitized and every surface wiped spotless. The medical staff prepared them with endless checks, IV lines, and instructions for what was about to come. Watching it all, I realized this wasn't just a routine operation — it was a fight for life.

While our parents were at the hospital, we stayed home, waiting for every update. They kept calling and telling us each step — the tests, the preparations, the waiting — and even hearing about it from far away was unbearably hard. If it felt this heavy just listening, we couldn’t imagine how much courage it took for them to actually go through it.

Morning arrived far too soon. The hospital corridors were still quiet, but in our hearts, a storm was raging. At 7:00 a.m., the nurses entered and began final preparations. Mumma and Papa were both given one last bath to make sure no germs remained on their skin. Fresh, sterilized gowns were given. The IV lines were checked, and pre-surgery antibiotics were administered. Their blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen levels were monitored constantly.

Mumma was taken to the donor preparation room, while Papa was taken to the recipient room. Both were separated now — and this was perhaps the most painful moment. They looked at each other, their eyes saying what words couldn't: “Be strong. We'll meet after this.”

The doctors explained the procedure one last time. At around 9:00 a.m., the anesthetists arrived. Mumma was taken inside first. She lay down on the cold OT table, lights glaring above, machines surrounding her. The anesthesia mask was placed over her face, and as the sedative spread through her veins, her last thought was of Papa — “This is for you.” First, Mumma's surgery would begin to carefully remove one of her kidneys. Once her kidney was ready and safe, the transplant team would immediately prepare Papa. Papa's failing kidney wouldn't be removed; instead, Mumma's healthy kidney would be placed in his lower abdomen and connected to his blood vessels and bladder. The entire process would take six to eight hours, depending on how smoothly everything went.

Meanwhile, Papa was waiting in another OT, already connected to monitors. As soon as Mumma's kidney was successfully removed and flushed with a special preservation solution, the transplant surgeon brought it to Papa's side. With incredible precision, they connected it to his blood vessels. Slowly, that kidney — now outside Mumma's body — began its work inside Papa's.

Outside the OT, hours felt like days. We sat, counting every minute, reading duas over and over. The nurses came out once to inform us that both surgeries were going well. Still, the fear didn't leave us until we saw them again.

On the morning of the transplant, my sister's Alaina, manha and my cousin sister were fasting and praying for them every single second. I was at college, writing my maths exam — present only physically, not mentally. My cousin sister was with me, consoling me throughout, and she told me that everyone at her house was also praying. Her mom would text me every single day to ask about my parents, check on us constantly, and remind me that “your parents are lion and lioness — they will fight through this.” After the exam, my cousin and my friend dropped me to the auto stand. I left for home, my heart pounding, wondering what was happening inside the operating theatre.

As soon as I reached home, Alaina told me the surgery was successful — Alhamdulillah! My chachu had called her and said proudly, “Your mom gifted her kidney to your dad on this Valentine's Day.” Both were unconscious, and doctors didn't allow any calls or visitors.

At around 5:00 p.m., the doors finally opened. First, Mumma was wheeled out — pale, weak, but breathing peacefully. Then, a little while later, Papa came out too. He looked tired but there was a calmness on his face we hadn't seen in months. The surgery was successful.

The doctors told us, “The new kidney has started working immediately. This is a good sign.” We couldn't stop thanking Allah in that moment.

Both were shifted to recovery rooms, still unconscious. We stood there, holding their hands, whispering prayers of gratitude. The battle was fought — and won.
