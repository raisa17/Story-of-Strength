<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<h2>Before the Storm</h2>
Life was moving so smoothly, almost like a calm river under clear skies. College, school, and home were all in their usual rhythm, and none of us had the slightest clue about the storm waiting just around the corner. Everything felt normal—ordinary days, ordinary laughter—until suddenly, on my 17th birthday, everything started to change oddly.

It all began in 2023. My papa, who had always been a healthy and active man, started falling unwell in September — exactly on my 17th birthday. He began showing unusual symptoms: persistent fever, swelling on his face and legs, restlessness at night, high blood pressure, extreme tiredness, and an unusual laziness. He would sleep a lot, which was very unlike him. Papa was always very energetic and full of life. This sudden change in him raised tension and concern in our entire family.

We are four daughters. And if you know how Indian society can be, you'll understand how people start their drama — “Oh, you have four daughters? How will you manage alone?” My papa was the only one working and providing for us. Still, he never once made us feel like we were lacking anything. He gave us everything we needed, and Alhamdulillah, we lived happily and peacefully.

But even before the health symptoms began, something else happened. On July 5th, a major recession hit, and the company Papa worked for let him go. He lost his job. So when these health issues began in September, my papa was already unemployed. Imagine — he had no job, four daughters studying in school and college, fees to be paid, and now this.

Despite all of that, he never complained. But my mumma — my superhero — immediately began taking him to a few doctors. Still, none of their treatments gave clear answers. Since his blood pressure was high, they just kept prescribing medication. But my mumma knew in her heart that something was deeply wrong.

One day in October, she could not wait any longer. She decided he needed to see a proper doctor. That day, I came home from college and opened the door. My mumma was in her black abaya, and my papa was wearing his white Calvin Klein T-shirt. As I entered the house, my mumma said, “There's food in the kitchen. Serve yourself and eat. We're just going to the doctor at HBS Hospital and will be back soon.”

My papa did not even speak to me. I could feel something was terribly wrong. His silence said more than any words. I sensed his stress, his pain — something deep and heavy. He looked so disturbed, and I felt anxious just seeing him that way.

And just so you know — my college is right next to that hospital. Literally the next building. From my classroom window, I can see the hospital. It takes not even a minute to walk there — maybe just 30 seconds. That place was about to become very familiar to us in a way we never wanted.

After they left, I began feeling anxious and uneasy. I turned to my sisters and asked, “Is everything alright?” My elder sister looked at me and told me something that made my heart sink. That morning, while we three were at college, my papa had gotten emotional and cried in front of her. He had said, “I don’t want to leave you all and go. I’m scared. What’s going to happen to me?”

Hearing that shook all of us. We sat together, silent but terrified. We could not afford to cry in front of our parents. We began praying for him with all our hearts.

Later that day, my mumma called and said, “Beta, Papa is in the ICU. His BP is too high. He needs to be monitored.” That one word — ICU — shook us. We had never heard that word used for anyone close to us. It only meant something serious. Terrifying.

Tears welled up in our eyes, but then we made a decision: We have to be strong. We cannot cry in front of Mumma. If she sees us weak, she'll break too. So we wiped our faces and held ourselves together.

My elder sister and I rushed to the hospital. We saw my mumma, our aunts and uncles there. We asked Mumma if we could go inside to see Papa. She nodded yes. We entered the room. He was lying there, asleep. But when we approached, he slowly opened his eyes. I went forward and held his hand. He let me. I held it tight, trying to comfort him. I whispered, “It’s nothing, Papa. You’re going to be alright.” He just nodded silently.

But my sister and I could see it. Inside, he was shattered. He was scared. He was trying so hard to be strong, but we knew his heart was breaking.

Just then, our cousin brothers and Phuppo — our papa's sister — arrived. One of our cousins walked up to him and asked, “Mama, what happened? How are you feeling?” Papa didn't respond. He tried again, “Say something, please, talk to us,” but Papa just stayed quiet. Tears rolled down his eyes.

Suddenly, my cousin broke down and cried, “Mami, why is Mama not speaking? Tell him to talk!” He started crying loudly, and I rushed to him and said, “Adeeb Bhaiya, please don't cry in front of Papa.” But he couldn't stop.

Watching him cry broke everyone. One by one, everyone in the room began crying.

Then, my mumma's uncle walked in and scolded everyone, “Why are you all crying? Nothing has happened. Adil, you're fine. You're going to be alright. Everyone, please leave the room. Let him rest.”

So we all stepped out quietly — shaken, worried, and holding back tears.

We sat outside for a while in the hospital waiting area. Mumma stayed back in the ICU with Papa. As we stood in the corridor, Mumma's uncle — who is like a grandfather to us — came toward me. His voice was gentle as he asked,
“What did you have? Did you eat anything?”
He looked at us with care and said,
“If you want anything, just tell me. I'll go get it. Would you like to eat fried rice right now?”

We smiled faintly, shook our heads, and said, “No, thank you. We're okay.”
Then I looked at my elder sister and said, “Let's go. The girls must be waiting at home.”

That night, our story wasn't just about a papa in the ICU. It was about four girls — four daughters who carried one papa in four different ways.

Alaina, the eldest, had become our strength. She had seen Papa cry earlier that day — something no child ever wants to witness — but she stood steady for all of us. With no brother in the family, she quietly stepped into a role no one had prepared her for. She wasn't just a sister anymore — she was our second parent, our quiet protector. The weight on her shoulders was heavy, yet she never let it show. She took care of everything — from managing the home to comforting us, making sure our younger sisters didn’t break down, even though she was silently falling apart herself.

Then there's me, Raisa, the second daughter — and the one writing this story. I've always been the emotional one, the feeler. I carry moments in my heart long after they've passed. Words are how I try to make sense of pain, and this story… is my way of holding on. That day in the ICU, when Papa let me hold his hand, I held more than just his fingers — I held his fear, his silence, his strength.

Manha, our third, is quiet yet strong in her own way. Sensitive, observant, and more mature than most people know. She's the kind of soul who says little but understands much — the one who notices when something's off, even when no one else does.

And then there's Zoha, the youngest — just 10 years old. Innocent, full of questions, and not yet ready to understand the world's weight, harshness. But even in her small way, she felt it. She sensed that something wasn't right, and all she wanted was for Papa to come home, safe and smiling again.
