<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<h2>The Diagnosis</h2>
The Next day we sisters were still attending college and school, unaware of what was coming. After my classes, I would run straight to the hospital since it was nearby, and my sisters would head there too as soon as they finished college."

After reaching the ward where Papa was admitted, we asked both Mom and Dad how they were feeling. Mom told us that the tests had been done in the morning, the reports were still awaited, and the doctors had yet to arrive .

The doctor walked into the room with a file in her hands, her face calm, her voice gentle. I had never seen a doctor so kind. She didn't rush. She first asked Papa a few questions, spoke softly to Mama and him, and then said something that gave a small flicker of hope:

"There is a problem… but it has a solution. Please don't be afraid."

Then she revealed the truth — Papa's kidneys were failing. He would have to start dialysis immediately.

For those who don't know, dialysis is a treatment that takes over the job of the kidneys when they stop working. It cleans the blood, removes waste, and balances the body's fluids — but it's not easy. The kidneys are closely linked to the heart; when they fail, the heart is also under pressure. It's a fight for survival every single day.

I didn't fully understand then. The doctor's softness masked the gravity of her words. But my parents knew. Tears filled their eyes. Still, they didn't hesitate — they agreed to the treatment without a second thought.

After the doctor left, I realised I hadn't eaten all day. My chachi offered to drop me home. Mama was busy with relatives coming in to see Papa. I told her I'd leave, but I could see the storm inside her eyes — she was breaking quietly.

When I was about to leave, I found Mama sitting on the hospital stairs, crying. My relatives were there, but her pain was raw and open. My chachi guided me towards the bike. On the way, we met my mum's closest sister, Asma aunty, with her husband. I don't know what came over me — i started crying seeing her, my voice trembling:

"Please… mumma ko samjhao, Asma aunty… she's crying a lot." she told "dont worry".And i left home.

That was only the third time I had broken down in front of someone — first my sisters, then my friend Afifa, and now her.

That night, Papa had to have a catheter placed in his neck for dialysis. A catheter is a thin tube inserted into a large vein so blood can be taken out, cleaned, and returned. Seeing it for the first time is shocking.

When Papa was taken to the OT — Operation Theatre — Mama completely broke. She cried so much the whole hospital must have felt it. My chachu, chachi, and cousin brother tried to console her, while we sisters stayed home praying.

The next morning, I skipped college. So did my sisters. We woke early, hearts pounding, imagining what was happening at the hospital. When Mama came home, we all went together to see Papa at 7 a.m.

He was asleep when we arrived, but when he woke up, we saw it — the tube hanging from his neck. It looked painful. He was in pain, but strong, Alhamdulillah, ready to fight for us. We spoke for a while and then left for breakfast. On the way, we picked something up from a small shop.

Back home, we ate, rested, then got busy with house chores. My nani cooked lunch. I tried to study for my NEET exams, but my mind was clouded. My elder sister balanced home and her college work; my younger sisters stayed quiet, helping without being asked, their innocence slowly turning into worry.

My college was right next to the hospital. Every day after classes ended at 5, I would go straight to see Papa. He was eventually discharged, but not the same as before — the catheter still hung from his neck. We were scared to touch him, afraid we might hurt him. Three times a week, he had to go back for dialysis.

The first time I saw the process, I couldn't stay long. There were so many patients — every bed occupied. Some were younger than Papa, some older, some his age… and even children. My heart sank.

Days passed. Papa continued with dialysis, but soon an infection developed at the catheter site. The doctors had to remove it and insert it on the other side of his neck. More pain.

That's when my taya — my father's cousin but like an elder brother to him — came from Saudi just for Papa. From day one, he helped like his own blood. We are forever grateful.

One night around 2 a.m., Papa felt unwell. Mama, the superwoman she is, took him to the hospital alone in the middle of the night. She wasn't scared — only determined to save him. She called my taya, and he rushed over. At 3:30 a.m., the bell rang at our house. It was taya, collecting things Mama needed for Papa. He saw our pale, worried faces and told us to rest, promising to take care of him.

Later, the doctors finally removed the catheter and performed a fistula surgery. A fistula is a connection made between an artery and a vein in the arm, used for long-term dialysis. It's safer than a catheter, but still, it's a painful reminder of the fight ahead.
