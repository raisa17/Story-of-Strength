<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<h2>The Recovery</h2>


Two or three days later, mumma video-called us from the hospital — mom and dad were in the same room, and the nurses were taking wonderful care of them. But seeing dad in pain was heartbreaking; he felt so weak that he thought he would die and slipped into depression. On that call, we didn’t cry. We just smiled and said, “We miss you… come home soon.” Nani couldn’t hold her tears, though — she cried seeing them, and so did we.

The doctors were initially happy — the kidney was working well — but dad’s mental state worried them, so they brought in a psychiatrist. Slowly, he began improving. Usually, transplant patients are discharged after five days, but my parents stayed in the hospital for nine days because dad’s case was very sensitive.

Meanwhile, at home, we turned everything upside down to keep it sterile. My sisters and I, along with nani, cleaned every inch of the house. My cousin brother and my taya also helped us sterilize everything — and taya, who would never normally clean anyone’s house, literally came to ours and wiped, dusted, and sanitized. We got separate utensils for papa, made sure no one used his things, and kept him completely isolated. We even put up a big “No Visitors Allowed” sign on our door to make sure no one brought in germs.

Chachu bathed dad regularly once he was home. Taya personally drove my parents to the hospital three times a week for check-ups. Everyone in the family helped in every possible way.

When dad came home, we sanitized his room thoroughly and were not allowed near him. For almost a month, only mumma entered his room to give him food. We wore masks inside the house and stayed away to keep him safe. The night he came home, dad wanted to see us so badly that he called us to stand outside his door. In actions, he asked me, “What are you doing?” and I gestured, “I have my Hindi exam tomorrow.” I teared up and quietly went back to my room.

Recovery was not easy. Dad was extremely weak and couldn’t walk properly — taya would hold his hand to help him move step by step. Over time, he began walking slowly on his own, first just to the hall, where he’d sit with mumma and watch a movie, while we stayed in our room to avoid risk. But with strict precautions — timely medication, healthy food, hygiene, no visitors, no crowds, and no contact with sick people — he steadily improved.

Alaina and nani managed the home beautifully, even though Alaina had college. Manha and Zoha stayed cautious about hygiene, doing their part to keep papa safe. My cousin sister and her mom never stopped checking in on us — they gave us strength, constantly reminding us that our parents were brave, like a lion and a lioness.

The recovery was long and tough, but the gift of life my mother gave to my father still keeps beating inside him. That kidney is the reason my dad has a second life — a life that is healthier, stronger, and more precious than ever.

The transplant surgery was performed at Manipal Hospital by Dr. Deepa Shree and Dr. Deepak, whose expertise and precision gave my parents a new lease on life. We are deeply grateful to them for their skill and dedication. We also sincerely appreciate the entire team of doctors, nurses, and staff at Manipal Hospital, who provided exceptional care and support during the nine days of recovery. Their constant attention and compassion made an otherwise difficult time much easier for our family.”

“This journey broke us, healed us, and rebuilt us — not as who we were, but as who we were meant to become.”

“This was not just a surgery, but a promise — that we will fight for each other, always.”

“We thought this was the hardest chapter, but it turned out to be the most beautiful one.”

“Pain walked in, but love stayed — and love always wins.”

"we will never forget those days"

Life slowly began to feel normal again. The storm had passed, and our home was no longer filled with fear but with gratitude. Dad came back to his usual self — smiling more, walking around the house, even cracking jokes like before — but things had changed forever. He now had to take medicines every single day, medicines that would stay with him for a lifetime to protect his new kidney. Regular check-ups, strict diets, and careful precautions became part of our routine. He had to avoid infections, stay away from crowded places, and follow every instruction the doctors gave. At first it felt overwhelming, but over time, these things became just another way of showing love — every pill, every check-up, every reminder was proof that we were guarding his life together.

and so on life became normal alhamdulilah.

<h2>THE BOOK</h2>

My dad was once added to a WhatsApp group where kidney donors and recipients from all over shared their journeys. Among them was Dr. Viney Kirpal — an IITian, a cancer survivor, and a transplant recipient herself. She decided to write a book documenting the real-life stories of every donor and recipient in the group, including my parents. These stories weren’t fiction — they were raw, real, and full of courage.

Since my dad is a creative designer, Dr. Viney asked him to design the cover of the book — and he happily did. Over months, as every story took shape, the book slowly came to life. The Book named "NEW LIFE NEW BEGININGS". 

Finally, on 2nd August 2025, the book launch was held in Pune. The doctors, donors and recipients featured in it were invited to Pune for the event. My parents decided to attend, and I accompanied them along with my cousin brother. We traveled from Bangalore to Pune, had a fun journey, reached our hotel, and got ready for the big event. My dad had even designed the ID cards for the recipients attending the function.

When we reached the venue, it was incredible to see every single person whose story lived inside that book—donors, recipients, and their families—all present under one roof. I met Dr. Viney Kirpal in person for the very first time. I had heard so much about her — she’s incredibly smart, full of life, and truly inspiring. She radiated enthusiasm, strength, and an unshakable spirit. Despite being a cancer fighter herself, her energy filled the room as she hosted the event with a warm, encouraging smile. 

The program began at 2 PM. Everyone who came on stage shared their story—the pain, the waiting, the risk of surgery, and finally, the gift of life. Hearing their voices reminded us we are not alone. There are so many who have suffered even more than us, yet have overcome it with courage and now live healthy, fulfilling lives because of donors.

My mother was honored as a donor, a moment that brought tears to our eyes. We felt immense gratitude—not just for her sacrifice, but for everyone who dares to take this step. Continuing lifelong dialysis would have meant endless pain and restrictions. A transplant is not easy—it’s risky, it’s frightening, and yes, one can even lose their life during the process. But if you are a fighter, you fight that fear, fight death itself, and come back stronger.

It wasn’t just kidney donors and recipients present — there were people who had donated or received hearts, livers, lungs, and more. Hearing everyone share their stories was deeply moving. It reminded us that we are not alone in this journey — so many others have faced even greater struggles and emerged stronger, living healthy lives today because of organ donation.

This experience strengthened my belief that these stories need to be heard. They inspire hope and encourage people to take the brave step toward transplant. Yes, it’s risky — one can lose their life in the process — but if you are a fighter, you fight death itself and come back stronger. Organ donation is not just a medical procedure; it’s a lifeline, a second chance, a gift of life.

We must spread these real stories so that more people step forward — because one donor can change not just a life, but an entire family’s future.

<h3>Thanksgiving</h3>

First and foremost, all thanks to Almighty Allah, who guided us and stood with us in every situation from the very beginning until the end, blessing us with strength and a beautiful family.



I’m deeply grateful to my mother’s family and my father’s family — both stood united without a moment of hesitation. Thanks to my sisters, with whom I stood strong through it all. Heartfelt thanks to my taya, chachu, and chachi for their endless love, care, and support — these moments will always stay with me.

A special thanks to my nani, who cared for us like our own mother, taking over every responsibility at home when Mom couldn’t be there. The love and effort she poured into us can never be forgotten.

To my cousins, thank you for your sincere prayers. To Shaima mami, our friends and so many others who constantly checked on my parents, sending encouraging words that lifted us when we were down — we are truly thankful.

Special thanks also to those who helped us financially when things became difficult. Your generosity eased burdens we couldn’t have carried alone.

Every message, every prayer, every visit, every kind word — we will remember it all. May Allah bless you all abundantly.

Looking back, we are deeply thankful that our family took the brave step toward transplant. Continuing with dialysis would have meant a lifetime of pain, endless hospital visits, and watching our father’s strength slowly fade away. The transplant wasn’t an easy path — it brought a full year of strict quarantine, countless precautions, and sleepless nights filled with fear and hope. But every hardship was worth it. Today, both our parents are doing well. The only lifelong commitment is taking medicines — not enduring the exhausting pain of dialysis. and that feels nothing short of a blessing.

This journey taught us something important: don’t delay decisions that can save a life. A transplant is not just a medical procedure; it’s a gift of time, strength, and freedom. Dialysis keeps a person alive, but a transplant lets them truly live. If anyone is facing the same choice, know that the road may seem hard, but the destination is beautiful. Life after transplant isn’t about pain — it’s about care, gratitude, and second chances.
